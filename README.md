#Translation API Class and Cases Initiative (TAPICC)
The TAPICC Project is a collaborative, community-driven, open-source project to advance API standards in the localization industry.   The overall purpose of this project is to provide a metadata and API framework on which users can base their integration, automation and interoperability efforts, rather than proliferating proprietary implementations which in the long run hinder collaboration and are expensive to maintain.
